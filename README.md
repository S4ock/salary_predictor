# Salary Predictor

## Overview

The Salary Predictor project is a Python-based tool that predicts salaries based on job-related features using machine learning techniques. This project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to estimate salaries given a set of input features, such as job title, company size, and other relevant factors.

## Features

- **Predict Salaries**: Estimates salaries based on job title, remote friendliness, company size, location, automation risk, AI adoption level, job growth projection, and industry.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations of salary distributions, job title distributions, and remote-friendly distributions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `plotly`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
